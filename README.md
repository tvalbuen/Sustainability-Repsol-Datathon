# ⚡ Solar Optimization for CO₂ Emission Reduction in Industrial Plants

## 🏆 Project: Repsol – IE Sustainability Challenge (6th Edition)

This repository contains our solution to the **IE Sustainability Datathon 2025**, focused on optimizing the energy usage of an industrial plant through **solar energy generation modeling**, **battery storage optimization**, and **CO₂ emission impact analysis**.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

In Spain’s energy transition, integrating intermittent renewable energy into industrial systems is a critical challenge. The datathon simulates a real-world industrial facility with a 175kWp solar installation (no grid feed-in) and evaluates:

1. The **maximum potential solar generation**.
2. **Battery charge/discharge optimization** for maximizing solar use.
3. **Quantification of CO₂ emissions avoided** by optimized energy use.

## 🎯 Objectives

### ✅ Objective 1: Solar Generation Potential
- Forecast the **maximum possible solar generation** (kWh) in September 2024 using historical weather data.
- Compare with actual plant usage to calculate **underutilized solar energy**.

### ✅ Objective 2: Battery Optimization
- Simulate a 100 kWh battery with 100 kW max power, allowing **one full charge/discharge cycle per day**.
- Maximize **Ra (Self-Consumption Ratio)** to increase energy efficiency and grid independence.

### ✅ Objective 3: Environmental Impact
- Use Spanish electricity mix data to calculate hourly **CO₂ intensity**.
- Optimize battery discharge during high-emission hours to **maximize CO₂ avoided**.
